# PorkPress-SSL
A wordpress multisite plugin for porkbun that can optionally update certbot for SSL.

## WP-CLI

The plugin exposes commands for managing certificates using Certbot's DNS-01
challenge. TXT records are created and removed through a bundled PHP hook
script that talks to Porkbun via their API.

Issue a certificate for one or more domains:

```
wp porkpress ssl:issue --domains="a.com,b.com" [--staging] [--cert-name="porkpress-network"]
```

Renew the certificate for all domains recorded in the manifest:

```
wp porkpress ssl:renew-all [--staging] [--cert-name="porkpress-network"]
```
## Standâ€‘alone certbot hook

`bin/porkbun-hook.php` can be used as the manual authentication and cleanup
hooks for Certbot. The script loads WordPress to obtain Porkbun credentials and
log activity via the plugin's `Logger`.

Example certbot invocation:

```
certbot certonly \
  --manual --preferred-challenges dns \
  --manual-auth-hook '/path/to/bin/porkbun-hook.php add' \
  --manual-cleanup-hook '/path/to/bin/porkbun-hook.php del' \
  -d example.com
```

Certbot sets `CERTBOT_DOMAIN` and `CERTBOT_VALIDATION` which the hook consumes.
If WordPress is not located automatically, set the environment variable
`WP_LOAD_PATH` to the directory containing `wp-load.php`.

## Porkbun API credentials

The plugin requires a Porkbun API key and secret to manage domains. They can be
supplied either through constants in `wp-config.php`:

```
define('PORKPRESS_API_KEY', 'pk_...');
define('PORKPRESS_API_SECRET', 'sk_...');
```

or via the network settings stored in the options `porkpress_ssl_api_key` and
`porkpress_ssl_api_secret`.

## Enabling `sunrise.php`

To enable sunrise functionality, add the following to `wp-config.php`:

```
define('SUNRISE', true);
```

Then copy the plugin's `sunrise.php` file into your WordPress installation:

```
cp /path/to/porkpress-ssl/sunrise.php /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/sunrise.php
```

## Certificate and state locations

Certificates are stored under `${PORKPRESS_CERT_ROOT}/live/<cert-name>/` and a
JSON manifest is written to `${PORKPRESS_STATE_ROOT}/manifest.json` describing
the active certificate. By default these roots are `/etc/letsencrypt` and
`/var/lib/porkpress-ssl` respectively. They can be customized in `wp-config.php`:

```
define('PORKPRESS_CERT_ROOT', '/etc/letsencrypt');
define('PORKPRESS_STATE_ROOT', '/var/lib/porkpress-ssl');
define('PORKPRESS_CERT_NAME', 'porkpress-network');
```

## Multisite lifecycle

PorkPress SSL listens for WordPress multisite events and updates its domain
alias table automatically. When a site is created, deleted, archived or
restored the plugin adjusts aliases and queues certificate issuance so SSL
coverage remains in sync with the network.

## Debian 11/Apache example

On Debian 11 with Apache, WordPress is typically installed under `/var/www/html`
and Let's Encrypt stores certificates in `/etc/letsencrypt`. An existing SAN
certificate for `adynton.com` may already reside in this directory; PorkPress
SSL can renew and expand it as additional domains are added.
